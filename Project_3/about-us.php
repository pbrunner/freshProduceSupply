            <p>Elise currently attends Colorado State University as a Journalism and Media Communication major. She also is pursuing an Information Science and Technology minor. Elise hopes to do web design and development, especially for non-profit organizations that donâ€™t have the personnel to keep up a website. Having an Internet presence is becoming more and more important for small business and nonprofit organizations. Currently, she is a Media Specialist Intern for the Scott College of Engineering. This includes everything from print posters, to Facebook and Instagram, to monitor display graphics in the Scott Bioengineering building.</p>
            <p>In her free time, Elise enjoys dancing, rock climbing, reading, and being outside. Her favorite things include teal, purple, and chocolate. And of course, running around barefoot. I like all things compost and want to some day have a giant produce garden and a couple of farm animals.</p>
